# Magework

This project is a work test commissioned by Magework that aims to simulate an electronic urn.

The project uses Angular 2, Bootstrap and Firebase (Firestore).

Basically, it simulates an electronic urn with three fictional candidates for the senatorial position.
The user has, above, a list of candidates; on the left, a screen with the information (initially unfilled) of the candidate who will vote and, on the right, a virtual keyboard for voting, along with the correction and confirmation buttons.

## Development server

Run `ng start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
